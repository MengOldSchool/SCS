How to run the program:
- ensure *.jar and a site map located at the same folder
- site map must be a text file
- run the simulation at the command line as: java -jar *.jap <"YouMapFile.txt">
- if a map is not defined, a default map will be used. 
- E.g of a command line: Java -jar SCS.jar "site_map.txt"
